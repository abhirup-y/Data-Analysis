#Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The dataset used includes various features of houses such as location, size, number of rooms, and age. The project involves:

#Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Building a Linear Regression Model
Model Evaluation
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook:
Navigate to house_price_prediction_linear_regression.ipynb and follow the instructions within the notebook to run the code cells sequentially.

Running Python Scripts:
Alternatively, you can run the Python scripts directly if you prefer:

bash
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Data
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns (features):

ID: Unique identifier for each house
Location: Geographical location of the house
Size: Size of the house in square feet
Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
Age: Age of the house in years
Price: The target variable representing the price of the house
Data source: [Link to dataset source or description]

Modeling Process
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing or scaling numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data distributions
Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features if necessary
Selecting important features for the model
Building the Linear Regression Model:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Fitting the linear regression model on the training data
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared
Results
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using the test dataset. Key metrics include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
R-squared: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Detailed results and visualizations of the model's performance can be found in the notebook.
